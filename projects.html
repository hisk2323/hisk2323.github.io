                            <p>This program takes 3 separate inputs from the user: a month (in the form of a digit from
                                1-12); a day (in the form of a digit from 1-31); and a year (any valid year). It then
                                computes that date in epoch time,
                                and prints this value to the screen. Finally, the program also selects a random date
                                from the same year that the user entered, and also prints this value to the screen. The
                                program takes leap years into
                                consideration to ensure that all printed values are correct. While this project is a
                                little simple compared to what we do in the more advanced CS classes, I chose to exhibit
                                it on my site
                                because it was really the first big
                                project I did after declaring my Computer Science major, and it feels special to me
                                because of that.

                            <p>This was one of my favorite projects that we did from Information Security. Of course,
                                the design of the actual webpage is pretty bad compared to what we're doing now in Web
                                Development; but the underlying
                                code was pretty interesting. I used CSS to make visited links (a:visited) display the
                                same color as the background, making them virtually invisible. I also made the links
                                unclickable and unselectable, and made
                                it so the mouse wouldn't change on hovering over them. This page makes users think the
                                univisited links are actually part of a CAPTCHA. However, their input is actually parsed
                                behind the scenes in a PHP server
                                to decipher which of the sites they have visited, and then make a recommendation to them
                                based on that.

                            <p> This is a project I've just been working on for fun. As I'm sure some of you know,
                                Spotify integrates with Discord's Rich Presence to
                                show your friends what song you're listening to. Since I use Apple Music (which does not
                                currently have Rich Presence integration)
                                I thought I'd try to put a little program together to accomplish the same thing. In the
                                image, you'll see a picture of it in action as well as how it compares
                                to Spotify's Rich Presence integration. The top view is Spotify's Rich Presence; the
                                middle view
                                is the one I wrote in Python for Apple Music; and the bottom view is the status bar icon
                                I implemented, which displays your currently playing song as
                                "song - artist".
